# Multilateration
## Golang research pet project
**Multilateration** in n-dimensional space with different errors and some experiments. \
Investigation of asynchronous methods for countering various interferences in the multilateration task. \
The program simulates an environment in which agents (sensors and targets) asynchronously solve the problem of determining locations in an n-dimensional space. 
# How to run
## Run UI
_in progress_
## Run simulation without UI
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EZHOWWW/Multilateration.git
cd Multilateration
go run cmd/simulation/main.go
```

# TODO
- [ ] UI visualization
- [ ] Asynchronous agents
- [ ] Methods for countering various errors
